# Kerning

Very simple program and/or script to transform input into more "**a e s t h e t i c**" form.  

**main.c** 
> Own implementation in **C**

**kerning.sh**
> Transforms input with the help of bash stream editor **sed**  

**Example I/O**  
> Also can be found in **in.txt** and **out.txt** files  

**Input:**  
*This  
is  
so  
useless*  

**Output:**  
*T h i s  
i s  
s o  
u s e l e s s*
